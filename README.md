This project helped me learn how to implement Artificial Neural Netowrk from the scratch for image classification problem. 

*What skills I learnt here:*

1. Using Tensorflow 
2. Using Keras 
3. Using Numpy 



*What this skills can help me for any future projects I take:*
1. Work in collaboration with Data Scientists for solving complex problems related to image processing in life sciences.
2. It helps me to build the Model with Artificial Neural Network
